							<div class="payment">
								<h3 class="policylabel">Payment Method and Booking Process</h3>
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Payment</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">All reservations and registration must be guaranteed with a valid major credit card.  We accept Visa, Master Card, American Express, and Discover Card.  Pursuant to credit card agreements, credit cards are not valid unless signed by the cardholder.  Credit cards must be signed.  Cash (USD) payment is welcomed with a signed and pre-authorized credit card.  All guests are required to present a valid major credit card and government issued photo identification even if guests are planning on paying in cash upon check-out.  Checks and foreign currency not accepted.</h5>
 
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Checks and Check Caching</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">We do not accept checks.  We do not provide check cashing services.</h5>
								 
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Debit Card/Credit Card Holders</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">Your credit card is not valid unless signed.  We will refuse an unsigned card.  Your Debit or Credit Card will be pre-authorized at check-in for the full amount of your stay.  The pre-authorization will HOLD the funds until check-out, at which time the amount actually incurred during your stay will be charged.  If you change your method of payment at check-out or change the length of your stay, your bank may not post the changes to your account immediately.  Hotel Valhalla has no control over the policies of your bank and will not be held liable for any “insufficient funds” penalties or any other resulting fees or charges.  It is your responsibility to fully understand the manner in which your bank processes pre-authorizations and charges to your debit or credit card.  Some banks hold pending authorizations for up to 30 days. </h5>
								 
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Deposits and Guarantees</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">There is no deposit required to make an individual room reservation.  However, a major credit card is required at the time of booking to guarantee the room and secure the reservation period.</h5>

								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">---</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Booking Process</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Guaranteed Reservations</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">All reservations must be guaranteed with a valid major credit card.  Guests must be 18 years and older.  We accept Visa, Master Card, American Express, and Discover Card.  We do not charge your credit card at the time you make your reservations.  Your credit card guarantees your reservations. Please make sure to receive a reservation confirmation number when you make a reservation. Reservations must be cancelled Forty-eight (48 hours), hotel time, prior to your arrival date, in order to avoid a one (1) room night, plus tax cancellation fee.  Reservations will be held until 11:00 a.m. the morning following your scheduled arrival date.  If you have not checked in by that time, a NO-SHOW charge of one room night, plus tax will be charged to your credit card and the balance of your reservations will be cancelled.  Hotel Valhalla is not responsible for weather conditions, personal emergencies, or schedule changes.</h5>

								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Check-in Time</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">4:00 p.m. </h5> 
								 
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Early Check-in/Pre-Booking</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">Early check-in is offered based on availability.  If you require a guaranteed check-in for arrival prior to 4 p.m. then Pre-Booking and payment may be required.  Please contact Front Desk staff directly to make reservations and complete a credit card authorization form prior to your arrival (406) 547-8888.</h5>

								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Check-in Requirements</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">Guests must be at least 18 years of age to check in at Hotel Valhalla.  In the interests of security and to prevent fraud, guests are required to confirm their identity by providing their valid government issued photo identification (State driver’s license, passport, etc.) at check-in.  A valid, signed, and pre-approved credit card in the name of the guest registration is also required.  It is your responsibility to fully understand the manner in which your bank processes pre-authorizations and charges to your credit/debit card.  Some banks hold pending authorizations for up to 30 business days.</h5>
								 
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Pre-Authorization at Check-in</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">We have required pre-authorized of credit cards/debit cards at check-in since 2007.  A pre-authorization is a temporary hold of a specific amount of your available credit limit balance placed on your credit/debit card for the full amount of your intended stay, plus tax.  All credit/debit cards are pre-authorized at check-in.  Pre-authorization is not a charge to your account, it is a hold on those funds.  Once your actual charge is posted at check-out it can take anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days for the original pre-authorization to be removed by your bank.  Generally, most banks release the hold within 3-5 days.  It is your responsibility to be aware of how your bank handles all of your transactions, including pre-authorizations.  We are unable to remove pre-authorizations directly through our hotel.</h5>
								 
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Guest Registration</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">We require valid contact information from the guest making the reservations including first and last name, address, phone number, and signature.  The names of all guests occupying the room must be registered (ARM 37.111.130).  Information regarding your license plate/car description is also gathered at check-in for security.</h5>
								 
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Check-out Time  </h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">Room rental period expires at 11:00 a.m.  Additional day charge, plus tax may apply for late checkout.</h5>
								 
								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Check-Out Procedure</h5>

If you require a later check-out, please contact Front Desk prior to the day of your departure and we will do our best to accommodate your request.  A charge may apply for late check-out.</h5>

								<h5 class="policyinfolabel">Early Departure</h5>
								<h5 class="policyinfo">Guests who check out of the hotel after 11:00 a.m. and prior to their scheduled departure date are subject to an early departure fee of one night, plus tax.</h5>
